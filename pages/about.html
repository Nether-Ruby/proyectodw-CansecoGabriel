        <h1>My story and why I want to develop videogames</h1>
        <p>I first started playing videogames when I was a kid. I was between 3 or 5 years of age at the time, and the first game I had ever played was Mario bros on the famicom.</p>

        <p>When I got to primary school, that's when I really fell in love with videogames, because I was lucky enough to play Resident Evil and Metal Gear Solid on the Playstation. Since I was only 6 years old, these games were really hard for me, but that's when I discovered how different, fun, and deep videogames could be. From the horror of Resident evil to the love and sadness present in MGS<p>

        <p>During my time in secondary school I started plying more horror games and some adventure games too on the Playstation 2. Games like resident evil 4, Rule of Rose and Shadow of the Colossus. But it was with Okami that I learned that games didn't need to resemble reality in terms of graphics: graphics were not that important. A game can be extremely stylised and be even more memorable in that way<p>

        <p>But it was when I got to university that I got into PC gaming and got my own Steam account and discovered my favourite genre of videogames: Soulslike games. I started playing Dark souls, then its sequel, then the last game in the franchise. And I've recently played Elden ring, and my favourite videogame: Sekiro. These games have taught me the importance of a well though experience, the exquisiteness of a perfectly crafted combat system, and the immersiveness of a world rich in history.

        <p>Everything I've learned from videogames in my life is the reason why I love this art form. This is why I'm passionate about making videogames, they've taught me a lot, they made me who I am. I've learned to cooperate, to feel empathy for those I don't understand, to never lose hope... Videogames are more than just an art form, they're experiences, they're learning opportunities, they are a means through which we can meet other people and work together even if we don't know each other's names. Videogames are part of my past, and will be a part of my future as well.
